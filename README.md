# MatlabforRollingObjects
Analyzes how different variables affect the way different types of objects roll

My Intro Physics class required me to write code that would analyze multiple different ways in which different types of objects could roll under different conditions. The first part of the code analyzes the position of two different types of objects position as they roll down an incline. The second considers a pipe with a multitude of different inner diameters and different inclines.

It's still a work in progress but, in general, you can change different variables to see how an object would act in a perfect scenario in real life
